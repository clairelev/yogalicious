    <h2>Denouement</h2>
<p>The death of Drew hit Carla harder than anyone could have imagined.To most people she was just obsessed with Drew but to
    her, she considered him the love of her life. Even though he spent the majority of that life barely noticing her existence.She was so shattered by his loss that it led
to the break down of her marriage. When reality came to knock her down by finding out she was the main suspect in Drew's murder, she realised that she couldn't face to live in a
world where people could believe that she was capable of doing something so heinous to the only man she truly ever loved.
Unable to process her grief and not willing to live in a world without him, Carla killed herself a couple of hours before she was due to get arrested. </p>

        <h2>Detective's Observations</h2>
        <p>It is a tragedy what happened to Carla and I am sorry that no one was able to see the distress she was in and offer her the help she needed.
            I will forever feel guilty in the part my investigation and suspicions had in her death. To some, her suicide would look like an admission of guilt. Upon hearing of her
            death, I decided to look again at the evidence we had against her and realised that she couldn't have possibly have committed the crime.
            I am truly sorry Carla for adding to your pain.
