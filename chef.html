    <h2>Statement</h2>
  <p>  I didn’t know Drew very well, we mostly had different schedules so outside of group meal times we had very little interaction. They seemed pleasant enough but honestly I don’t know what they were doing here in the first place. Yogalicious is all about the health of mind and body and yet every meal time without fail they ordered a burger. And do you know what the worst part is? They would request to have all the salad removed. Who does that?</p>
  <p>  They clearly weren’t taking the retreat seriously at all, if you ask me I think someone saw that as a sign of blatant disrespect for everything we are all hoping to achieve here and was just fed up with it. Not that I think that’s a valid reason to kill someone over or anything, just I can see where they might have been coming from, you know?</p>
  <p>  Me? Oh I was in my room all afternoon. I decided to skip the yoga class that afternoon as I was feeling unwell and just needed some time to do some peaceful meditation by myself. I had a very productive session and didn’t leave my room until I was informed of the murder.</p>

        <h2>Detective's Observations</h2>
        <p>Definitely hiding something though no known confrontations with the victim. Unable to provide an alibi for the time of the murder. Was clearly paying a lot of attention to the victim to be aware of their food preferences at each meal.</p>    </div>
