            <h2>Meet the Suspects</h2>

        <p> <b>Chad Roswell:</b> founder of the rival sewing club. He was once again over stating his skills at work and said that he was a professional amateur at sewing. That he was better than some of the people on the Sewing Bee. Feeling that he spent enough time at work with Brad, he didn’t want to spend any more time with him than strictly necessary outside of work so started his own club.<br>
           <br>
           <b>Brad Coswell:</b>work colleague of Chad’s and sewing enthusiast. He’s one of two of the members of the original sewing club left. He doesn’t get on with the other member as they once had a disagreement over which sewing machine was the best one.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Tina Learner: </b>second remaining member of the original sewing club. She has a very high opinion of her sewing abilities and doesn’t like to be second best which started a few conflicts with some of the other members of the club including Brad who she finds obnoxious.<br>
        <br>
