    <h2>Poor Brad</h2>
<p>Chad was devastated at the loss of his new friend Drew. For some reason he couldn’t help but feel like it was his fault that Drew had died. Upon returning to work, he told his upper management that he had lied on his application and much to Brad’s dismay he was praised for his honesty and was allowed to continue in his role and was even promoted within the team.
    When he was arrested for Drew’s murder, the prosecution quickly realised that they didn’t have enough evidence to take him to trial and he was released without any further charges and was allowed to continue in his daily torment of Brad.</p>          </div>

    <div class="detective">
        <h2>Detective's Observations</h2>
 <p>I can’t believe I ever thought Chad was capable of murdering Drew. It was a serious error in my judgement and falsely accusing him had serious repercussions for me. I’ve been demoted in my current role and not allowed to investigate any more murders until I learn to investigate them more seriously.</p>  </section>
