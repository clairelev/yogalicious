<p>The evidence kept stacking up against Yvonne not only for this murder but for the death of several other people. She felt like in her work that so little of it was in her control and hated the fact that she was constantly seeing guilty people being let off without any punishment that she decided to take justice into her own hands. It started off with petty crimes which then grew to killing people and she just couldn’t stop herself. She liked having the control of deciding who lived and died. During her trial, it was discovered that she suffered from delusions, paranoia and other mental illnesses and she would spend the majority of her time in prisons receiving the treatments she desperately needed.</p>

        <h2>Detective's Observations</h2>
<p>When I arrested Yvonne, she admitted to killing Drew. She revealed that Drew had found some of the snack wrappers in Chad’s room and he recalled seeing them in his wife’s possession the previous year. He knew that they weren’t Chad’s as Chad had ran out of snacks so Drew decided to snoop in other people’s rooms and discovered the stash in Yvonne’s room. Knowing that Yvonne was a health fanatic and wouldn’t possibly put that sort of junk in her body, he decided to confront her over the reasons why she would have them in her room. He guessed that Yvonne was planning on killing Chad and had killed his wife the previous year. The reasoning behind it was that she wanted to get rid of the hypocrites in this world and couldn’t stand people like Chad who joined health retreats but had no intention of improving their health and making a mockery of the place. He told her that he was going to call the police but sadly she attacked him and killed him before he had the opportunity. If she hadn’t attacked Drew, her killing other people could have gone unnoticed for years as most of her victims died in unusual circumstances weeks after the Yoga retreats.</p>  </div>
