    <h2>Guilty of tampering</h2>
 <p>The sneakiness of Chef reported from several other suspects and his attention to detail on the victim’s movements and habits made Chef a prime suspect. When he was arrested, he panicked and revealed that although he had committed a crime at the retreat, that the crime was not murder. It turned out that the main chef was a former rival of Chef and that the idea of health food based restaurant at the retreat was his. Angered by having his idea stolen and his rival’s success, Chef had been tampering with food in the kitchens and placing meat sourced stuff in the vegan menu.  After the retreat Chef was going to report his rival and was hoping on getting the restaurant shut down.</p></div>

    <div class="detective">
        <h2>Detective's Observations</h2>
<p>Although Chef is not guilty of murdering Drew, I still feel like his arrest was a success as we have removed a very dangerous individual from the streets. Tampering with food is extremely dangerous and could have potentially killed someone with allergies. He clearly needs professional help and counselling to help him get over this vendetta he has created with his rival.</p>
