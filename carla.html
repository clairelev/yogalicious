    <h2>Statement</h2>
   <p> Words cannot describe how I am feeling right now. How has this happened? Why him? I came on this retreat to reconnect with him. I know that it’s been twenty years since anything has happened between us but there’s not been a day that has gone by that I haven’t thought about him. When I heard his wife had died, I waited what I thought was an appropriate amount of time before getting back in touch with him. I didn’t really know how to do it because it is a bit weird to randomly message someone that you haven’t spoken to in years. When I saw that he was coming on this retreat, I saw an opportunity for us to really reconnect without the pressures of outside life interfering. It’s funny because the first yoga retreat we did was when we were 18 and it was on that retreat that he met his wife. But I would rather not talk about that particular trip. Booking this retreat was the best decision I’ve ever made. He was so happy to see me and all the feelings and connections that were there before still existed now. I think he realised he made a mistake by not choosing me twenty years ago but he was relieved that he still had the opportunity to make the right decision now and not waste any more time. I was the happiest I’ve been in years, and to have all my dreams taken away so shortly after I’ve got them is just so cruel. I honestly don’t know how I can exist in a world where he’s not in it. I’m not sure I want to.</p>
    <p> At the time of the unspeakable event, I was next to the lake, trying to prepare how I was going to tell my husband that I was leaving him. And also trying to find a way where I wouldn’t sound too happy when I said it. Even though, he wasn’t the person I was meant to be with, he wasn’t a bad husband and he doesn’t deserve to be someone’s second choice. I knew I was being selfish when I married him but in my own way I do love him and I never for one minute thought Drew would be available again.</p>
        <p> When I was next to the lake, the only other person I saw was Yvonne, but I was too preoccupied in my own thoughts to notice which building she went into.</p>

        <h2>Detective's Observations</h2>
        <p>Carla is clearly obsessed with the victim. It wouldn’t surprise if she had been stalking the victim online for years and was monitoring his whereabouts and future plans so she could plan the occasion to ‘bump into him’. I don’t think she felt any sadness for him over him losing his wife and only saw the benefit to her. Her statement also contradicts what Chad said that the victim had told him about the two of them. By the sounds of it, Drew was not interested in pursuing a relationship with Carla at the moment and I do not know how well Carla would have handled this information.</p>
