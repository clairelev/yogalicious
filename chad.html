    <h2>Statement</h2>
   <p> I’m just going to say this now as I’m sure some of the other attendees here will have told you that I am clearly not a yoga expert and yet here I am at an expert yoga retreat. It’s all because of Brad at work, I blame him for this whole mess. When I looked up the company when applying, I saw on the website that yoga was big for them so I might have lied on my cv and maybe made it sound like that I have been doing yoga for years. They were so excited about going on the work trip and me having the opportunity to show them my knowledge that I had to fake an illness to get out of it. I mean you can’t go to a work trip and have your whole work place discover you are a fraud. Anyway, Brad my work nemesis clearly knew I was faking and probably deduced the reasons behind it. He suggested they should book me this trip instead as it was such a shame for me to miss out and here I am. But jokes on him, because actually it turns out that I am not that bad at yoga and I actually I don’t mind all the healthy food, my skin looks the best it has done in years.</p>
    <p> Anyway back to Drew, I’m gutted he’s dead, we became close over the last couple of weeks. At the time of the murder, I was in the gym waiting for him because we had a deal, like he would show me different yoga positions and the correct way to do them and I would show him the right types of workouts to do for his body. I may know nothing about yoga but I know a lot about working out. You must be able to tell by how great I look. But he never showed and when I went to look for him, there he was in the mediation centre,dead. I was so shocked and didn’t know what to do, I just panicked and that’s why I didn’t raise the alarm. I know Sabrina was in the juice bar at the time because I walked past her on the way to the gym, but she kept going in and out of there and she looked really stressed. I also saw Chef heading towards the kitchen, but by the way he was moving and acting, it looked like he was trying to do it discreetly which obviously makes it more obvious that you’re doing something you shouldn’t be doing. But I couldn’t tell you what it was because I didn’t really care to find out. The guy is just a bit strange.</p>
        <p> What do I know about Drew that could relate to the murder? Well, he used to come and hang out in my room in the evenings. I think he knew that I snuck in some snacks to the retreat and he too couldn’t go days without his sugar fix. I mean if I knew that I would be sharing them, I would have bought a lot more with me. I was devastated when I ran out a couple of days ago. I admitted to him how I came to be here and he started telling me a bit about his life. He told me that he and his wife used to do this retreat every year and that his wife died shortly after last year’s one but he came back this year as he just wanted to do something that felt normal. He said that he knew Carla from his school days and how he was shocked to find her at this retreat as he hadn’t heard from her in years and then suddenly over the last few months she kept popping up everywhere. He said that they used to be really serious all those years ago and for reasons unknown they went their separate ways and it was sad. Even though he was happy to see her again, it was just too soon after the loss of his wife for him to be looking at someone else, even if that person was Carla.  </p>

        <h2>Detective's Observations</h2>
        <p>Clearly isn’t afraid to lie his way through life and could be the case that if he thinks he admits to lying in the past that it would make us believe that he is telling the truth now but he could still be lying.</p>
        <p>    He was the one to discover the body and yet didn’t raise the alarm. No one knows how long he was in the mediation room before Sabrina walked in. It could be the case that she walked in after he finished killing Drew, no one saw what time he left the gym.</p>    </div>
