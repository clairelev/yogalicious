        <h1>Deadly wedding</h1>
        
        <p> It’s the big day for Brad and Lacy Coswell. The day was going perfectly until the wedding meal where several of the guests started to become ill and needed urgent medical help. Unfortunately, a couple of them didn’t make it to hospital on time.<br>
            <br>
            It’s down to you once again as the detective to solve this crime. Who could have poisoned the guests? Did they want people to die or did they just take it too far and who would want to sabotage the lovely wedding of Brad and Lacy?

            <h2>Meet the Suspects</h2>

        <p> <b>Chad Roswell:</b> Chad is the brother of the bride. Everyone knows that he has had a vendetta against Brad for a while and that he was less than thrilled when he learnt his sister was marrying the guy. Could he have sabotaged the wedding in an effort to break the two of them up.<br>
           <br>
           <b>Brad Coswell:</b>Groom and work rival of Chad. He had a very short relationship with Lacy before declaring that she was the one for him. Has he done all of this to get back at Chad but unfortunately with deadly consequences?<br>
        <br>
        <b>Third suspect will be revealed in the Spring 2022 </b><br>
        <br>
       <i> Meet more suspects when the game comes out in Summer 2022!!!  </i>
