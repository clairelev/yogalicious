    <h2>Statement</h2>
<p>At the time of the murder, I was walking back from a walk by the lake. I walked past Carla who looked very angry and upset. I think her and Drew knew each other from outside the retreat. I also saw them having an argument a couple of nights ago but I was too far away to hear any of it.</p>
    <p>   I was on the way to my room when I saw Sabrina, she was heading back towards the juice room with cleaning stuff so I assume she’s had another one of her clumsy moments. I met her and Drew last year when I did my first retreat. I got the impression that she has known Drew and his wife for many years. Such a tragedy what happened to his wife, so young too. But there wasn’t any love lost between Sabrina and his wife. I don’t know what happened but it got to the point where they couldn’t be in the same room together. But Drew seemed civil to her this year.</p>
        <p>  I was in my room when I heard about the murder and I was the only one in the rooms as I was the only one heading downstairs when we were asked to vacate the premises. I don’t think anyone else came upstairs between me arriving in my room and leaving as I heard no doors opening and the doors are quite squeaky.</p>
            <p>  What can I say about the other two people here? Chef, I don’t really know much about. I think he has other motives for being here other than the yoga but he has got really technique and has clearly done yoga before.</p>
                <p>    That other idiot Chad has ruined the experience for the rest of us. Constantly asking stupid questions, taking up instructors time as he has to be shown the most basic of moves. Always moaning about the food. Seriously it’s a pity that Drew was the one that died instead of him.</p>

        <h2>Detective's Observations</h2>
        <p>Yvonne is a strange one. She is clearly a health fanatic who has very black and white views on how things should be. Also, she revealed very little about herself in the statement and her relationship with Drew. Is she trying to distract me by going on about the other suspects?</p>
