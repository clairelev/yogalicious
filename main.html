    <h1>Murder at Yogalicious</h1>
    <span id="greeting"></span>,
    <p>
        On Thursday the 25th of July, at the world famous Yogalicious Retreat, Drew Carpenter, a regular visitor to retreat was found dead by Chad Roswell in the mediation room. The police were quickly called to the scene by Sabrina Smith and found that Drew had been hit over the head by a Buddha statue. The statue was found next to the body. Unfortunately, no prints were found on the statue.
        </p>

    <p> Aside from the statue,an earring was found near the body that does not appear to belong to the victim, some wrappers from a well-known brand, and he smelt of some pretty strong kitchen cleaning products.</p>

<p>At the time of the murder, five fellow visitors were in the retreat with Drew and all of them are suspects in the murder. It’s now time for you Detective (Insert your name here) to read through the suspects’ statements and work out whether or not you can find Drew’s killer and bring them to justice.</p>

        <h2>Detective's Observations</h2>
        <p>Rarely have I seen such a gruesome scene as the one of Drew’s murder, it is imperative that we catch the killer.
            Before meeting the suspects, here is some evidence that I have gathered so far:
            <ol>
            <li>Carla owns the other earring to the one found near Drew’s body as she was only wearing one earring at the time of questioning.</li>
            <li>Both Yvonne and Chad had the same make of the brand wrappers in their bedroom.</li>
            <li>Sabrina and Drew have past history, they’ve stayed at the resort many times during the same period. The yoga instructor also informed me that before Drew’s wife died last year, there were arguments between her and Sabrina.</li>
            <li>Yvonne was also at the resort during the same period last year.</li>
            <li>There’s just something suspicious about Chef.</li>
        </ol>
