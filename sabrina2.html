    <h2>Still received a fine</h2>
   <p>Sabrina was devastated to learn she was a suspect in Drew’s murder but more so in the fact that her holiday was ruined. She was also still shocked to have received a bill for the stained carpet through the post a few weeks after the event as she was pretty sure that the murder of Drew would have made everyone forget about the stain. She was arrested and put on trial for his murder but the jury eventually found her not guilty. Upon release, she decided to treat herself to another yoga retreat and it was during that retreat that Sabrina was murdered herself, leaving the detective to believe that they could have a yoga serial killer on the loose. </p>

        <h2>Detective's Observations</h2>
      <p>I was so surprised when the jury found Sabrina not guilty, I was so convinced that she had done it. Surely no one would care that much about a stain on the carpet. My failure in finding the right killer eventually led to her murder and it will be to my eternal shame that I failed Sabrina. In my many ways if the jury had found her guilty, it would have worked out better for her as she would be still alive to this day.</p>
