    <h2>Statement</h2>
    <p>I’ve known for Drew for years, I wouldn’t say we were friends but we were on friendly terms. He and his wife have been on several of the same retreats as me and when you see people frequently, you get to know them quite well.</p>
        <p>At the time of the murder, I was really stressed because I had spilt my drink in the juice bar. I know it’s a juice bar and people must spill drinks all the time but they don’t. That place is immaculate and they have carpets on the floor. Why use carpets in a place where people are likely to spill things on it? But there’s not a single stain on that carpet. Well, there wasn’t before today. I panicked when the glass just slipped out of my hand. I’m sure they charge you extra if you damage the property and my family really can’t afford it at the moment as the kids have trips abroad next year with the school and those things are so expensive. Everyone would know it was me that made the stain because I am the clumsiest person here. You seriously don’t think they’ll charge me extra, do you?</p>
            <p>So I went to the kitchen to get some cleaning stuff to help remove the stain. On the way there I saw Chad going to the gym but he wasn’t there when I got back unless he was working out in the dark because the lights of the gym were off. In the kitchen I saw Chef, I couldn’t tell you what he was doing in there, only that he jumped when he realised I was in the room and looked extremely guilty. Like I caught him doing something he shouldn’t be doing. I grabbed my cleaning stuff and on the way back I saw Yvonne but I couldn’t tell you where she was going as I was too preoccupied on getting back to my stain before it dried. But poor Yvonne, death just seems to follow that woman everywhere. Like it was her first retreat here last year and Drew’s wife died shortly afterwards. I heard that someone at her work died this year unexpectedly and now Drew. I just feel so sorry for her. But I also don’t get why she’s on this retreat? When speaking to her, all she goes on about is the importance of a healthy lifestyle and the importance of eating healthy and how she wouldn’t put processed garbage in her body. When I was looking for something in her room, I came across her supply of snacks so clearly she’s lying about not eating processed foods. All that time she spent at meal times criticising Drew and Chad over their meal choices. It’s just a bit hypocritical.</p> 
                <p>Whilst cleaning my stain, I heard a weird noise coming from the mediation room so I rush to go and see what was happening. It was then that I saw Drew on the floor and Chad in the corner looking distraught and in shock. He was in no position to call for help, so I did. And then the rest you know as you arrived on the scene.</p>
                    <p>Hopefully now, no one notices the stain as they have a murder to be more preoccupied with.</p>

        <h2>Detective's Observations</h2>
        <p>Not really sure what to make of this one. Surely no one gets that stressed over a stain? Is she trying to distract me by going on about the most mundane things. What was she doing snooping around in Yvonne’s room and did she visit anyone else’s room?</p>
